<p>Fried chicken is a comforting dish, often reminding us of picnics, summer, and simpler times. Keep in mind that boneless chicken breasts cook faster than bone-in chicken. Pan-fried chicken breasts are just as crispy as deep-fried, but take a little less planning (and a lot less oil).</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-fried-chicken-breasts">Instructions to make Fried chicken breasts:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Put half a bag of BBQ chips in a ziplock bag, use the roller, to roll them out and crush them up. (regular sized bag, not the party size or individual size) it is a 7.75 oz bag, only use half of it. (Honestly idk why he didn't use the blender or chopper, I think it would work just as well, if not better)</li>
<li>In a bowl, mix the crushed up chips, with the flour, and add in your seasonings</li>
<li>Cut the chicken breasts in half, down the middle, to make 10 chicken breasts. That way they aren't to thick, and they cook and get done better.</li>
<li>Break the egg open in a separate bowl. Beat the egg up, until the yolk is broken and mixed together good. Now dip the chicken in the egg, covering both sides. And then dip the chicken in the chip and flour batter.</li>
<li>In a skillet, pour some vegetable oil in there, enough to fry the chicken. Keep on medium to low heat. Let the oil heat up.</li>
